# Strem.Plugins.Twitter

A plugin adding integration with twitter so you can send tweets and potentially other actions

> This originally was part of the `Strem` app but due to the twitter API changes its been moved out to its own plugin and is no longer bundled with Strem.

## Installation

Go to the latest release, download the latest plugin and extract it into your `Plugins` directory.

## How To Use?

### Plugin Setup

When the plugin has been added you should see it being started in your logs, then you will need to [get your twitter client id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) and add it to the twitter integrations screen. 

Once you have your client id you can connect it up with the permissions you need and then you should unlock the relevant Tasks/Triggers.
